# E-Commerce Backend - MVC Structure Documentation

## Overview

The ecommerce backend has been reorganized following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern for better code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure

```
ecommerce-backend/
├── models/                 # Data models (Sequelize)
├── controllers/            # Business logic layer
├── views/                 # Presentation layer
├── routes/                # URL routing layer
├── defaultData/          # Seed data
├── images/              # Static assets
├── server.js            # Application entry point
└── package.json
```

## Benefits of MVC Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Code organized by function
2. **Testability**: Controllers tested independently
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features
4. **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
5. **Reusability**: Controllers and models reused across views/routes

## API Endpoints (Unchanged)

All API endpoints remain the same as documented in documentation.md
